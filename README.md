**ESX/QB supported with bridge.**

Requirements: https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases

**Notes**:

You must find a way to utilize the event 'randol_medical:client:targetPulse' for your police/ambulance jobs. Using a radial menu or an ox lib actions menu or something. If you wish to turn it into a server side job locked command, you'll have to change it from AddEventHandler to RegisterNetEvent so the server can read it.
